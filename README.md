Hi! I'm Avvai Alias Aravind

ğŸ‘€ I'm interested in front-end development. I love creating beautiful, interactive user interfaces that deliver a great user experience.

ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning the latest front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. I'm also honing my skills in CSS and JavaScript to create responsive designs.
